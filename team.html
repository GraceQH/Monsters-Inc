   <h1> The city of Monstropolis in the monster world is powered by energy from the screams of human children.
   </h1>
   <p> At the Monsters, Inc. factory, skilled monsters employed as scarers venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to the children's bedroom closets. It is considered dangerous work, as human children are believed to be toxic.
